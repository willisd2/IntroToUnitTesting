Intro to Unit Testing

For those that are interested in the automated portion (09-ATM_Jasmine_Automated) you'll need to download node.js (https://nodejs.org) and open up a node.js command prompt.  From there, navigate to the root of the 09-ATM_Jasmine_Automated folder and run the command 'npm install'.  This should install all the required node_modules (a node_modules folder should be created in the root folder).  By default karma is setup to run in Chrome, so make sure you have Chrome installed.  Otherwise you'll need to edit the karma.conf.js to use another browser.  Furthermore, you'll need to install a karma launcher node_module for that browser.
